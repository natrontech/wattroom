# Deploying WattRoom (ADR-0002: one VM, one compose stack)

First time, on the VM:

    mkdir -p /opt/wattroom && cd /opt/wattroom
    # copy this deploy/ directory here
    cp .env.example .env            # fill it (sops-managed in the homelab repo)
    cp livekit.yaml.example livekit.yaml   # real keys, same values as .env
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

Every deploy after that is a tag bump in `.env`:

    WATTROOM_TAG=v0.4.0
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull wattroom
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d wattroom

A rollback is the same three lines with the previous tag. That works only
because migrations are expand/contract (ADR-0019): a release only adds, and
drops land one release *after* the release whose code stopped using the thing.
Break that rule and the old binary meets a schema it cannot serve.

Releases are cut by hand — `git tag v0.4.0 && git push --tags` — which builds
`ghcr.io/natrontech/wattroom:v0.4.0` and opens a GitHub Release whose notes are
generated from the squashed conventional-commit titles. Pushes to main still
build `:main` for testing; never pin the VM to it, because a moving tag has no
previous version to go back to. The server migrates its own schema at boot, so
pull + up -d is still the whole path.

Check what actually landed — the second one is a real database ping now, not a
hardcoded "ok":

    curl -s https://wattroom.ch/api/version    # {"version":"v0.4.0",...}
    curl -s https://wattroom.ch/api/healthz    # ok

#311 puts all of this on a timer that also refuses to interrupt a ride.

Planned maintenance is `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop wattroom`
— Caddy then serves maintenance.html (which polls /api/healthz and reloads
itself) until `up -d wattroom` brings the binary back. No flag, no mode.

DNS: wattroom.ch A/AAAA to the VM. Caddy takes TLS from there. Open 80, 443
(tcp+udp), 7880-7881, and LiveKit's RTC UDP range on the VM firewall.

After the first deploy, set the two GitHub repository secrets that switch on
the production synthetic (#55): PROD_URL and PUSHGATEWAY_URL. Grafana points
at the prometheus service; dashboards are the homelab's, per its own rules.
